use minimalistic diff patches at first try, then incremental diff patch, but never intend to write big files unless asked to 
do not write self-evident comments alongisde the code
do not use too long variable names, stick to 8-10 chars, and i/j/k/l for iterators and obvious stuff
be conscise in writings, im with 20 years of experience, and read fast, but tmi makes me sad
